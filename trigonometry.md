<h1>Trigonometry</h1>
As this is a very important subject and I did pretty not remember everything I resolve to review some concepts and for that, I chose a book to follow along, this process
will be similar to the repository where I review concepts about ES6.

The reference for this review will be the book 'Trigonometry For Dummies'. This choice is due to the easy comprehension and fast read that the book offers
<h2>Part-1</h2>
At this section very essentials concepts was convered such as:
<ul>
  <li>Circumscribe a triangle</li>
  <li>Angle location </li>
  <li>Trigoometric functions</li>
  <li>Centroid</li>
  <li>Naming angles by their value</li>
  <l1>Pythagoras theorem</li>
</ul>

Therefore, for each item subjec a resume will be done, starting by how to circumscibe a triangle.

<h2>Circumscribe a triangle</h2>
A triangle can be circumscribed by finding a point that is the intersection among the bisect lines that has an origin at the vertices. To bisect a segment of a line
is necessary to divide the segment line into equal parts. The point that belongs to each bisecant line will be the origin of the circle. And for the radius of that
circle is only necessary to calculate the distance between the new point with one of the vertices.

To make easy the understanding of this process the image below is present.<br/>

<h2>Angle location </h2>
An angle can be anywhere in the circle and for this reason there is a name for each possibe possition pre-defined. This pre-defined position is usefull to have a name
because the relation between the angle and the arc changes acordingly where the point is locate. The image below is a resume of the location and relation between position angle and 
length arc
